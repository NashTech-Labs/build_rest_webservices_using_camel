# Getting Started
**Build Rest Services using Apache Camel**
This template will help to know about how to write REST WebServices(GET and POST) using Apache Camel from scratch. 
We only have to write some instructions for Camel, and it will use a bunch of other components to expose your REST service for you.

**Requirements**
> JDK 1.8 or more download.
> Apache Camel Maven dependencies.
> Postman for testing.

Steps to test your application as given under:
> Login to postman 
> For GET Rest webservice, hit the URL http://localhost:8080/services/pin/244717.
> For GET Rest webservice, hit the URL http://localhost:8080/services/pin.
